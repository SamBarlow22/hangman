##Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain number of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer randomly generates a word from a list and the user attempts to guess the word by entering indiviudal letters. The player must guess the word before all sections of the hangman have been added, where each failed guess at a letter results in a section of the hangman being added.

### Features
- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words.
- Allows the player to input letter guesses.
- Provides feedback on whether the guessed letter is in the word.
